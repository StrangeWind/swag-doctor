## Getting started

To work on this package, you will likely want to be able to perform changes on the fly without having to build your documentation each time. Development tools are setup to enable just that.

1. Make sure you are using node version 4.2
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`

Now you can make changes to src/examples/advanced.js and view your updated documentation at http://localhost:4001.

##Rules
* Please squash your commits

## Builds
Please do not run builds if you're submitting a PR. The maintainers of this repo will take care of that if your pull request goes into the master.

## Other thoughts
Nothing else comes to mind. Just make sure you test your work before submiting a PR.
